\section{Summary}
{I am a fullstack developer with 5+ years of professional experience.
\\
With an interest in technology from a very young age, I've been around computers ever since I can remember. When I first came into contact with programming in my teenage years, I was instantly fascinated. Since then, I have not stopped programming, either for fun or professionally. I found programming to be a valuable skill, and on top of that, it keeps me motivated to deepen my knowledge and push my own limits every day.
\\
In 2023, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Currently, I'm focusing my studies on the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem, with tools like React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, Bun, etc.}
